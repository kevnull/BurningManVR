# Burning Man VR
A simple attempt to create the playa within a Room Scale environment.

A satirical video of the experience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfpYzFFkn-U

## Current Features
- major recognizable landmarks: The Man, A Temple (2007), Church Trap, and a bonus, The Sisya (2016 art)
- somewhat dynamic duststorm (generated on a curve to ensure participants experience one within the first couple of minutes)
- scaling audio of duststorm to go with how much of a whiteout you're in
- several moving cyclists (not animated)
- art cars and bikes kick up appropriate amount of dust during movement
- art car has spatial sound so you can hear it get louder or quieter depending on where it is relative to you
- general background sounds

## Next
- teleportation/movement to major landmarks
- dancers and Burners dance and move based on certain personalities and affinity to music or art
- randomly generate hundreds of Burners
- smarter animation cycles for characters
- vehicles stop or move along paths
- improved skybox

## Future
- Night mode
